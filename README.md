### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

#### Domain Adaptation for Conversational Knowledge Selection

**Position: Research Assistant, IR Lab at Shandong University**

- We observe similarities between KS process in KGC and Response Selection. An effective transfer learning mechanism will enhance the Dialogue Generation with Retrieval-based Dialog System. 
-  Propose a Dual Domain Interaction algorithm to mitigate the negative influence of domain shift and task discrepancy, learn transferable feature representations in multiple domains.

#### Knowledge Aware Conversation Generation 

**Position: Research Assistant, IR Lab at Shandong University**

- Previous studies on Knowledge-Grounded Conversation have two limitations: (1) they do not model knowledge tracking and shifting and their interaction explicitly, (2) MLE only relies on demonstrated conversations to train the model, which cannot handle the many-to-many mapping phenomenon in conversations well. 
- Propose a Dual Knowledge Interaction Network (DukeNet) to address the first issue, and Dual Knowledge Interaction Learning (DukeL) to address the second issue. 
-  Experimental results on two public KGC benchmarks show that DukeNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both automatic and human evaluations.

#### Multi-modal AI Music Generation 

**Position: Algorithm Design, DeeCamp, Sinovation Ventures**

- Use ResNet-places365 to analysis sentiment tags of short video and generate tag based multitrack real-time by Music Transformer combined with Performance-RNN. 
- Propose a MIDI correction algorithms and a chord matching algorithm based on music theory. Build a music composing process. 
- Develop apps with excellent user experience. Deploy deep learning models on the server and achieve high concurrent performance.
